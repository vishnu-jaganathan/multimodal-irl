## Expectations
1. Conducted a reasonable literature review
2. Identified a clear, novel research question – even if it is “just” incremental
3. Developed a new or augmented an existing algorithm
4. Tested that method
    - If the method is an improvement (i.e., the results positive), then show why it works by conducting a sensitivity analysis and ablation studies
    - If it is not a successful improvement on prior work, show that you tried three unique methods and that all of them did not work
    - In both cases, develop insights into why the method was successful or unsuccessful

## Project Proposal Requirements
2-page proposal
- Project motivation
- Description
- Data and plan to collect the data
- Expected outcome
- Identification of benchmark
- Timeline

### Address the [Heilmeier Catechism](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism):
- What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
- How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
- What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
- What are the risks?
- How much will it cost?
- How long will it take?
- What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?

## IRB  Application
Training and evaluation of LfD requires working with human-subjects. If you want to publish with the data you collect during this project, you must receive Internal Review Board (IRB) approval. Each group is encouraged to submit one application. The IRB application is ungraded and only required for students  wishing  to  disseminate  the  results  of  their  course  projects  in  the  broader  academic  community  (e.g., a workshop, conference, or journal paper).

- Teams who submit an IRB application will receive +1 on their final grade
- Teams who get approval for their application will get an additional +1 (total of +2) on their final grade

**Please note:** Dr. Gombolay is required to certify any IRB application, and he reserves the right to reject an application if it proposes unethical experimentation or is otherwise deficient 

## Project Update
1-page summary, 10-minute in-class presentation detailing the progress to date on executing the project proposal
- Presenters’ peers will provide feedback
- The final project presentation grade will be influenced by how well students incorporate helpful, reasonable feedback into their projects

## Project Presentation
8-page conference-style paper, 10-minute in-class presentation detailing students’ contributions for their research project
- Abstract
- Introduction
- Related works
- Methods
- Results (must include a benchmark that the students applied to their data set)
- Discussion
- Conclusion
